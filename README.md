# Learning Langchain

### `langchain_expression_language.ipynb`
This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to use the LangChain library to build complex language model pipelines. 

**Features**

- Simple Chain: This notebook demonstrates how to build a simple language model pipeline that generates a joke about a given topic.

- Complex Chain: This notebook shows how to build a more complex pipeline that retrieves relevant documents based on a query, generates a prompt based on the retrieved documents and a question, and uses a language model to answer the question.

### `openai_function_calling.ipynb`

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to use the LangChain library to call OpenAI functions. 

**Features**

- OpenAI Function Calling: This notebook demonstrates how to define and call OpenAI functions using the LangChain library. It includes an example of a function that retrieves the current weather for a given location.

### `langchain_openai_function_calling.ipynb`

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to use the LangChain library to call OpenAI functions. 

**Features**

- OpenAI Function Calling: This notebook demonstrates how to define and call OpenAI functions using the LangChain library. It includes an example of a function that retrieves the current weather for a given location.

### `tagging_and_extraction.ipynb`

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to use the LangChain library for tagging and extraction tasks. 

**Features**

- Tagging: Tagging is the process of assigning labels to pieces of text based on their content. This notebook demonstrates how to use LangChain to tag text with information such as sentiment, language, and reflection.

- Extraction: Extraction is similar to tagging, but it is used for extracting multiple pieces of information from a text. This notebook shows how to use LangChain to extract information about people and articles from a text.
